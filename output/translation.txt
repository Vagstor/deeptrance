Avangard head coach Guy Boucher commented on the team's two consecutive losses to Metallurg Magnitogorsk (1-3, 3-2) in the 2025 Gagarin Cup playoff series.  

— How is the team's psychological state after two losses?  

— Nothing went wrong. It's just that everything shows we're facing two evenly matched teams—gritty and skilled. We're up against the reigning champions; they didn't win that title for nothing. Everything is going as we expected. It's a hard-fought series, no matter how it started. Every day is a new day for me, every game is a new game. Tomorrow starts with a clean slate, and momentum doesn't carry over from game to game or period to period," Boucher told Championat correspondent Lev Lukin.
